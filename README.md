# POWER-APPS-PROJECT
Using Power Apps, I was able to create an application that monitors ATMs and their health status(cash jam, ATM balances, card reader, journal printer etc) on a real-time basis.  This provides the ATM management team and custodians a platform to view and monitor the status of ATMs in their respective locations by logging in to the Application.
Leveraging on Power Apps integrated PowerBi, a solution was born
